*Humans use text. Computers speak bytes*

# Texts verus Bytes



## Character Issues
The Unicode standard explicity seprates the identity of character
from specific byte representations:
1. The identity of a character --ites code point
-- is a number from `0` to `1,114,111`(base 10),
shown in Unicode standard as 4 to 6 hexadecimal digits with a "U+" prefix.
For example, the code point for the letter `A` is `U+0041`.
About 10% of the valid code points have chatacters assigned to them in Unicode 6.4,
the standard used in python 3.5
2. the actual bytes that present a chatacter depend on the encoding in use.

```python
s = 'A'
s.encode('utf8') # Encode str to bytes using UTF-8 encoding
```

```python
b'\x41'
```

```python
s = '你好'
len(s)
```

```python
len(s.encode('utf8'))
```

```python
len('a'.encode('utf8'))
```

```python
len('é'.encode('utf8'))
```

## Byte Essentials


The immutable bytes types introduced in python 3 and the mutable `bytearray`,
added in python 2.6.

```python
cafe = bytes('café', encoding='utf_8') # bytes can be built from str, given an encoding
cafe
```

```python
cafe[0] # Each item is an integer inn range(256)
```

```python
cafe[:1] # Slice of bytes are also bytes--even slices of a single byte
```

Although binary sequence are really sequences of integers, their literal notation reflects the fact
that `ASCII` text is often embedded in them.


Binary sequences have a class method that `str` doesn't have called `fromhex`,
which builds a binary sequence by parsing of hex digits optionally sparated by space

```python
bytes.fromhex('31 4b CE A9')
```

```python
import array
numbers = array.array('h', [-2, -1, 0, 1, 2]) # Type code 'h' creates an array of short integers(16bits)
octets = bytes(numbers)
octets # These are 10 bytes that represent the five short integers
```

```python
list(octets)
```

## Basic Encoders/Decoders

```python
for codec in ['utf8', 'utf16', 'gbk']:
    print(codec, 'café hello 中文'.encode(codec),sep='\t')
```

```python

```
